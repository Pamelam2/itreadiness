  <h1>Pamela Martin</h1>
  <p>I'm an Academic Technologist. I find innovative technologies that can be incorporated into online and  hybrid classes at the University of Arkansas. I also check the accessiblity of online courses, and make them compliant to the ADA laws. I am married to a biologist who does research on American box turtles, and I have a 3 year old who loves costumes, mostly of the super-hero kind.</p>
  <p> My career goals:
    <ul>
      <li>Learn front-end development.</li>
      <li>Improve student experience by implementing Universal design into online courses.</li>
      <li>Help bridge the silos workhouses on campus to improve the secondary education experience to students at the U of A.</li>
   </ul>
