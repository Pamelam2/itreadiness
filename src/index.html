         <h1>Pamela Martin</h1>
  <p>Born in Santiago, Chile and raised between Miami, Florida and Siloam Springs, Arkansas. I am married to a biologist who does research on American box turtles, and I have a 3-year old who loves costumes, mostly, of the super-hero kind.</p>
  <p>I graduated from the University of Arkansas in 2011, and I have been working at the University since 2010. Currently, I work for Global Campus as an Academic Technologist. My job is to find innovative technologies that can be incorporated into online and  "hybrid" classes for the purpose of improving academic success. I also check the accessiblity of online courses, and make them compliant to <a href="https://www.section508.gov/content/learn" target="_blank">Section 508</a>.</p>
  <p> My career goals:
    <ul>
      <li>Learn front-end development.</li>
      <li>Improve student experience by implementing Universal Design into online courses.</li>
      <li>Help bridge the silos workhouses on campus to improve the secondary education experience for the students at the U of A.</li>
   </ul>
